Title: Stock Price Forecasting with Prophet - README

Description:

Welcome to the Stock Price Forecasting project using the Prophet library in Python! This project aims to help you forecast the stock prices of three major technology companies - Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc. - through time series analysis and prediction. By following the steps outlined below, you'll be able to retrieve historical stock data, prepare the data for Prophet modeling, fit the Prophet model, and visualize the forecasted stock prices.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or later recommended).
Install required libraries using the following command: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib prophet yfinance pandas_datareader.
Download the Project:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Running the Program:

Open the Python script stock_price_forecasting.py in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Handling Common Problems:

Problem 1: Import Error for Prophet Library

If you encounter an import error for the Prophet library, make sure you have installed the library using pip install prophet.
Problem 2: Data Retrieval Failure

Ensure you have a stable internet connection to download stock data from Yahoo Finance via yfinance. In case of connection issues, try running the program again.
Problem 3: Data Formatting Errors

Verify that the downloaded stock data contains all necessary columns (e.g., 'Date' and 'Close'). If any column is missing, check for potential issues in the data retrieval step.
Problem 4: Fitting Failure

If the Prophet model fails to fit, check for possible data issues, such as missing or invalid data points. Additionally, review the time period specified for data retrieval and consider adjusting it.
Problem 5: Visualization Errors

Ensure you have the required libraries installed (e.g., plotly) for interactive visualization with plot_plotly. If visualization fails, try using the default matplotlib plots.
Customization:

Feel free to modify the start and end dates (start and end variables) in the script to fetch different historical data.
Experiment with the daily_seasonality parameter in the fit_forecast_prophet function to toggle daily seasonality patterns in the model.
Conclusion:

This project serves as an accessible guide to forecasting stock prices using the Prophet library. Follow the instructions in the README to resolve common issues and successfully run the program. Explore time series analysis, predict stock prices, and adapt the code for other financial data. Happy forecasting!
